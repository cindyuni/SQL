#### [1661. Average Time of Process per Machine](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the `'end' timestamp` minus the `'start' timestamp`. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the `machine_id` along with the **average time** as `processing_time`, which should be **rounded to 3 decimal places**.

#### ðŸ’¡ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT a1.machine_id,  round(avg(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) as processing_time
FROM Activity a1
JOIN Activity a2
ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id and a1.process_id = a2.process_id
WHERE a1.activity_type = 'start' and a2.activity_type = 'end' 
GROUP BY a1.machine_id;
