# 🧠 LeetCode SQL Practice - SQL 50

This repository records my ongoing practice of SQL problems from [LeetCode - SQL 50]([https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/)).  
The goal is to strengthen my SQL skills through real-world-style challenges involving filtering, joining, aggregation, and advanced querying.

## 📌 Focus Areas

- Data filtering using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`
- Aggregations with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Table joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, etc.
- Schema normalization and case formatting.


## 📝 Notes

I try to follow consistent formatting:
- Uppercase SQL keywords
- Snake_case for column and table aliases
- Comment headers explaining each step
- LeetCode problem number in filename for easy reference
