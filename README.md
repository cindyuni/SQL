# 🧠 SQL Case Study Practice

This repository contains my personal SQL practice, organized by case studies. Each folder represents a different dataset, problem domain, or project-style challenge. The goal is to practice SQL in realistic scenarios and improve my data querying, cleaning, and analysis skills.
